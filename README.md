# Game Lobby Simulator using a dynamically allocated Linked List - Rony Hanna   
A simple interactive Game Lobby Simulator I made for fun where the user can place as many player nodes as 
they want and perform several operations (such as kicking a player out from the lobby) with a 
graphical representation of the singly-linked list data structure.

## Adding Player Nodes

Few features and improvements I might add to this in the future:
- The ability to kick any player within the list.
- Improving to a doubly-linked-list.
